It's a mainnet-ready flash loan execution script written in Rust.

### USDC TX<br>

## Setup

First, do:
```git clone https://github.com/Trinityweb3/Flash-loan-impl-example```

Second, create a .env file in the your project root.

RPC_URL=https://helius-rpc.com/xxxxxxx<br>
PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxx(base58)

And compile & start a script using ```cargo run``` 

## Customising

All protocol addresses are taken from the official Save Finance Docs. 
They're there - https://docs.save.finance/architecture/addresses/mainnet/main-pools

If you want to switch from USDC to SOL or USDT, you just need to swap the hardcoded Pubkeys constants in src/main.rs

!!! Notice: If you borrowing SOL you must remember that $SOL has 9 decimals instead of USDC's 6!!!
  
## Returning 20% of fees

Actually, Save Finance charges a 0.05% total fee from flash loans. But the protocol architecture is designed to reward front-end integrators like a host fee mechanism
So, a total fee spliting on<br>
1 - 80% goes directly to the protocol treasury (fee_receiver_ata).<br>
2 - 20% goes to the integrator (host_fee_receiver).

## How this code exploits it:
In the repay_ix accounts vector, we pass our own wallet's ATA as the host_fee_receiver. Thus, by acting as our own host, we automatically save 20% of the loan costs.<br>
